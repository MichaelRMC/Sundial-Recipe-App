      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This easy-to-make banana pudding has all the things you want in a
        dessert: honey-like fruit, velvety vanilla pudding, and the crunch of
        buttery wafers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>6 ounces vanilla wafers</li>
        <li>3 bananas</li>
        <li>3 cups vanilla pudding</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Slice bananas in about 1/3 inch thick rounds. Place four glasses that
          hold about 2 cups each on your work surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add about four vanilla wafers to each glass. If necessary, snap them
          in half to create an even layer. Top with 4 or 5 slices of banana.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon about 1/4 cup of pudding over the bananas. Repeat the layering
          process a second and a third time. Serve!
